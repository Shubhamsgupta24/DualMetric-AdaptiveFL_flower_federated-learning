The time it takes to process a refund can vary depending on several factors, such as the payment method used, the vendor's refund policy, and the complexity of the refund request.

In general, refunds for credit card payments usually take 5-10 business days to appear on your account statement. However, it's important to note that some credit card companies may require additional processing time.

For refunds processed through online payment platforms, such as PayPal or Stripe, the timeframe can range from 1-30 days, depending on the platform and the specific circumstances of the refund.

If you made the payment through bank transfer or other offline methods, the refund process may take longer, as it often involves manual verification and processing by the vendor.

To get a more accurate estimate of the refund duration for your particular case, I recommend contacting the vendor or service provider directly. They will be able to provide you with specific information based on their refund policies and processes.
