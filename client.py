    1) Create a simple sequential model with embedding layer, global average pooling, dense layer with relu activation and output layer with softmax activation:
        a) Embedding layer: This layer will take 25 length sequence of words and convert them into 64 dimensional vector(64 features representing the word) and the output shape will be (25,64) where 25 is the maximum length of the input sentence that we are giving to the model and the output will be a 25*64 matrix as every word of that sentence will be vectorized into 64 characteristics.The 800 is the vocabulary size which is the number of unique words in the dataset that the model needs to expect.
        b) Global Average Pooling: The input given to this layer will be the 25*64 matrix and the output will be a 64 dimensional vector of (64,) shape which is the average of the features(64 averaged features) which helps to tells you how important each feature is on average in the entire sequence i.e it summarizes the sentence.
        c) Dense layer: This layer has 64 neurons and each neuron receives all 64 feature values as inputs.Every neuron learns to detect or respond to a specific combination of those features.Each neuron applies : z = (w1 * x1) + (w2 * x2) + ... + (w64 * x64) + b where w1,w2,...,w64 are the weights and x1,x2,...,x64 are the input features and b is the bias.Then it is passed through ReLU activation function a non-linear function: f(z) = max(0,z) which helps the model to ignore irrelevant patterns (negative values are set to 0) and focuse on important patterns (positive values are kept as they are).
        d) Dense layer: This layer has 11 neurons which is the number of classes in the dataset in this case now it combines the 64 features into a single value (or logit) for each class.For neuron j in the output layer: z_j = (w1_j * x1) + (w2_j * x2) + ... + (w64_j * x64) + b_j where w1_j,w2_j,...,w64_j are the weights and x1,x2,...,x64 are the input features and b_j is the bias.Each neuron in this dense layer corresponds to one of the 11 classes and then the softmax activation takes the 11 logits and converts them into probabilities(11 probability outcomes i.e (11,)) that sum to 1.This way, the model gives a probability for each class, and the class with the highest probability is the prediction.
